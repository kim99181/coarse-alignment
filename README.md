# tm_ws — vision-guided connector alignment

A TM5-900 arm, a Toyo CHG2 gripper and an Intel RealSense D405 on the wrist,
positioning the gripper over a named socket on a multi-port panel.

Scope is alignment only. Getting the plug the last few millimetres into the
socket is done separately, under admittance control.

## What is here

Only `src/py_gripper` is tracked here -- pose estimation, the arm command line
and the CAD tooling. It needs two third-party packages dropped alongside it in
`src/`, neither of which belongs in this repository:

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/tm2_ros2` | Techman's ROS 2 driver: <https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tm2_ros2> (branch `humble`) |
| `src/robotic` | Robotiq 85 gripper packages |

```bash
git clone -b humble https://github.com/TechmanRobotInc/tm2_ros2.git src/tm2_ros2
```

## How the pose is found

One greyscale frame and the CAD, per frame, at about 27 Hz:

1. **Find the panel** — Otsu over the whole frame. It is black on a pale bench,
   which is the easiest threshold in the pipeline. The largest *solid* blob
   wins, not the largest one; cables are darker still but fill a fraction of
   their bounding box.
2. **Find the ports** — adaptive threshold inside the panel only, with the
   neighbourhood sized from the working distance. Deliberately over-detects.
3. **Decide which port is which** — two blobs paired with two CAD ports fix a
   similarity outright, so the search enumerates those pairings and scores each
   by how many other ports land where it predicts. The mapping is forced to be
   mirrored, because the port face points at the camera.
4. **Solve the pose** — `SOLVEPNP_SQPNP` against the CAD port centres. The
   distance comes out of this solve; it is not measured by the depth sensor.
5. **Refine** — re-measure each port inside its own projected outline and solve
   again.

The depth stream is used for one thing: a RANSAC plane fit that pins the panel's
tilt, which a single planar view is genuinely weak at. Everything else --
position, scale, heading, which port is which -- is image and CAD only. On a
matte black panel that is the point: its depth returns cannot carry a scale.

Measured on hardware: 8 of 8 ports matched, 0.75 mm mean reprojection.

## Running it

```bash
colcon build --packages-select py_gripper     # from the workspace root
source install/setup.bash
```

Vision, arm driver and camera:

```bash
export ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1
ros2 launch py_gripper tmr_depth_launch.py part:=server1
```

Arm command line, in a second terminal:

```bash
ros2 run py_gripper arm_cmd --ros-args -p part:=server1
```

`ROS_LOCALHOST_ONLY=1` is not optional on a shared lab network -- another
machine on the default domain will otherwise publish into the same topics.

### Settings that do not travel

Three things in `config/` and one in the launch file are specific to the rig
they were measured on. On the same robot they carry over; on a different one
they do not, and using them unchanged will put the arm in the wrong place:

| | |
|---|---|
| `config/ICA_Lab_UMI_Config.yaml` | hand-eye calibration -- where the camera sits on the flange, including its 24.4 deg tilt |
| `config/opening_reference.json` | port table, valid only for the panel it was generated from |
| `robot_ip` in `launch/tmr_depth_launch.py` | |
| `table_z`, `roll_usb`, `roll_hdmi`, `roll_rj45` on `arm_cmd` | bench height, and how each plug sits in the jaws |

### Commands

| | |
|---|---|
| `ready [45cm] [dry]` | park above the bench, flange level |
| `holexy <port> [roll] [dry]` | square up over a port, height unchanged |
| `hole <port> [roll] [5cm] [dry]` | as above, and stand off from the port face |
| `h [5cm\|5mm] [dry]` | straight down, pose untouched |
| `1` / `0` | gripper open / close |

`dry` prints the target without moving, and is worth using every time.

Port names come from the CAD table: `usb1`-`usb4`, `rj451`, `rj452`,
`hdmi1`, `hdmi2`. A debug stream runs at <http://localhost:8091/>.

## Adding a panel

Models live in `src/py_gripper/cad/`. Drop the STL there, add it to
`tools/build_reference.py`'s `MESHES`, then:

```bash
~/.local/bin/micromamba run -n foundationpose python tools/build_reference.py
```

It ray-casts the port face, measures each opening and writes
`config/opening_reference.json` -- the table the runtime actually reads. The
models for the panels here are committed, so a fresh clone can regenerate that
table rather than having to trust the copy in the repository.

One thing worth knowing when designing the panel: make the port layout
asymmetric under **reflection and a half turn**, not just under rotation. The
panel here is very nearly symmetric under both, and two separate classes of
mis-identification came out of that.

## Tests

```bash
python3 tools/test_mono.py
```

Runs the pipeline over two captured frames -- the panel in two orientations,
different lighting -- and checks the port labelling against the physical
hardware. Two frames rather than one on purpose: every regression this pipeline
has had was invisible in the first.
