"""Bring-up for the depth-only pose route (no FoundationPose).

Deliberately a separate file from tmr_grip_launch.py rather than a flag on it,
because the two routes publish the same topics and must never run together --
having them in one launch invites exactly that mistake.

Differences from the FoundationPose bring-up:
  * align_depth is on. The hand-eye calibration is expressed against
    camera_color_optical_frame, so the pose has to be computed on depth aligned
    to colour or the depth-to-colour extrinsic shows up as a fixed offset.
  * the camera node stays running. FoundationPose needs the device to itself and
    the notes say to pkill it; this route consumes its topics instead.
  * fp_pose_bridge is not started.
