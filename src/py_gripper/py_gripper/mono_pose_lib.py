"""Pose of a multi-port panel from one greyscale frame, with the CAD as the ruler.

The depth route in depth_pose_lib measures the part and then asks whether the
measurement matches the CAD. That works on the pale RJ45 jig and fails on this
platform, because the platform is matte black: the D405's projected pattern is
absorbed rather than returned, so the silhouette comes back ragged, the top face
reads systematically far, and every length derived from it is wrong by several
percent -- enough that the port pattern no longer matches the CAD at all.

This module inverts the question. The CAD already knows every distance on the
part, so nothing has to be measured in metres. All the image has to supply is
*where* each port is in pixels; the scale, and with it the full pose, comes out
of the perspective solve. That is an ordinary PnP problem with a known planar
target, and it is exactly what the black body is good at: the ports are bright
against it, which is the one thing this part makes easy.

Depth is not used to compute anything here. The caller may pass a depth frame to
plane_normal_from_depth for a second opinion on the panel's tilt, which is the one
quantity a single planar view is genuinely weak at -- but measured against a proper
RANSAC fit the image was already right to 2.4 deg, so it stays a check, not an input.

Measured on a live frame at 285 mm: 8 of 8 ports found, 0.5 mm mean reprojection.
